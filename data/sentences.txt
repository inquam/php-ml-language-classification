How’s life?
How have you been?
How’s your family?
What’s up?
What’s new?
What have you been up to lately?
I’m fine, thanks. How about you?
Pretty good.
Not bad.
Great!
Couldn’t be better!
Can’t complain.
I’ve been busy.
Same as always.
Not so great.
Could be better.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you so much.
Thanks a million!
Thanks for your help.
I really appreciate it.
I’m really grateful.
That’s so kind of you.
I can’t thank you enough.
I owe you one.
You’re welcome.
No problem.
No worries.
Don’t mention it.
My pleasure.
Anytime.
It was the least I could do.
Glad to help.
Sure!
Thank you.
I’m sorry that I was so rude yesterday
It’s my fault.
Oops, sorry.
I should have called you and told you I’d be late
I apologize for the delay 
That’s OK.
It happens.
No problem.
Don’t worry about it.
I forgive you.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I don’t think we’ve met before.
This is great
I’d like you to meet my parents
Have you met him?
I’d like to introduce you to her
Nice to meet you.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
And you.
Really?
That’s interesting.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Gotcha.
Sure.
It was nice chatting with you.
Well, it’s getting late.
Anyway, I should get going.
Sorry, but I’m afraid I need to…
I’m sorry to cut you off, but I actually gotta run.
Hi, this is Jane.
May I speak with John Smith?
Is John there?
I’m calling about…
I’m returning your call.
One moment, please.
Hang on a sec.
He’s not here. Would you like to leave a message?
Could you ask him to call me back?
Thanks for calling.
Can you tell me where to find a computer store?
Could you tell me the way to the buss station?
I'd like to know when the package will arrive?
Do you know where the store is located?
Do you have any idea when dinner will be ready?
Could anyone tell me what time it is?
Would you happen to know where I put my mobile phone?
I don't suppose you would know when the buss arrives?
I was wondering how much a ticket is?
I’m calling to find out when the show starts?
I have no idea.
I can’t help you there.
Beats me.
I’m not really sure.
I’ve been wondering that, too.
What do you think about having potatoes for dinner?
How do you feel about moving to another city?
What's your opinion of Windows 10?
What are your views on centralized data storage?
In my opinion Linux is a great operating system.
I'd say you should try it.
Personally, I believe ghosts are not real.
If you ask me, I will tell you.
The way I see it free food is good food.
From my point of view you are missing the point.
I’ve never given it much thought.
I don’t have strong feelings either way.
It doesn’t make any difference to me.
I have no opinion on the matter.
Whatever.
Exactly.
Absolutely.
That’s so true.
That’s for sure.
I agree 100%
I couldn’t agree with you more.
That’s exactly what I think.
That’s exactly how I feel.
Tell me about it
You’re telling me!
I’ll say!
I suppose so.
I don’t think so.
I beg to differ.
I’m afraid I don’t agree.
I’m not so sure about that.
That’s not how I see it.
Not necessarily.
Yes, but I like candy.
On the contrary.
No way!
I totally disagree.
Congratulations!
That’s great!
How wonderful!
Awesome!
I’m so happy for you!
Oh no.
That’s terrible.
Poor you.
I’m so sorry to hear that.
I’m sorry for your loss.
Are you free Saturday night?
Are you doing anything Saturday night?
Let me check my calendar.
Do you wanna see a movie?
Would you like to join me for dinner?
I’d love to!
Sounds great!
I’d love to, but I have another commitment.
I don’t think I can.
Maybe another time.
Would you like a drink?
Do you want some water?
Can I get you something to eat?
That’d be great, thanks.
No, thanks. I’m OK.
I’m going to buy a new computer.
I’m planning to move to another city.
I hope to buy a house one day.
I’d like to have children one day.
I love soccer.
I’m really into soccer.
I live for soccer.
soccer is my thing.
I’m crazy about soccer
I’m not a huge fan of modern art.
Modern art isn’t my cup of tea.
I don’t really care for modern art.
I’m not into modern art.
I can’t stand modern art.
How about trying something new?
Why don’t you talk to your boss?
Maybe we should do more research.
I’d recommend going to the doctor.
Have you thought about buying a new computer?
Where do you work?
What do you do?

I’m not quite over my ex.
Pardon?
Would you mind repeating that?
What do you mean?
I’m not sure I follow you.
Could you explain what you said earlier?
Do you understand what I’m saying?
Does that make sense?
Do you know what I mean?
Are you with me so far?
Is that clear?
I need a little help.
Could you help me out?
Could you give me a hand?
Could you spare a couple minutes?

You’re doing great.
Don’t give up!
Hang in there!
You can do it!
Give it your best shot.
Nice job!
You did great!
I’m not happy about this.
I’m sorry, but this is unacceptable.
I’m not very satisfied with this product.
I can’t stand it when the internet is slow.
This sucks.
I’ll always remember this.
I’ll never forget this.
If I remember correctly I liked it.
As far as I can recall I didn't like it.
I have a vague recollection of the smell.
It’s on the tip of my tongue.
My mind went blank.
It doesn’t ring a bell.
Please remember to take out the trash.
Please don’t forget to feed the dog.
I’d like to remind you about picking up the package.
You haven’t forgotten to feed the cat have you?
It completely slipped my mind!
It’s a piece of cake.
It’s a cinch.
It’s a breeze.
Anyone can do it.
There’s nothing to it.
It’s hard.
It’s a bit tricky.
It’s really tough.
It’s not a walk in the park.
It’s very demanding.

I’m stuffed.
Where’s the remote?
Is there anything good on?
Can I change the channel?

There are too many commercials.
Stop channel-surfing.
Check the TV guide.

What is the purpose of your trip?
It cost a fortune.
It cost an arm and a leg.
That’s a rip-off.
I can’t afford it.
That’s a bit pricey.
That’s quite reasonable.
It’s off.
That’s a good deal.
It was a real bargain.
It was dirt cheap.

It’s bedtime for me.
I really should get some sleep.
I promise that I’ll be on time.
I won’t be late.
No matter what happens, I’m going to…
Come hell or high water, I’ll…
Sorry I’m late.
I overslept.
My alarm didn’t go off.
I had to wait ages for a bus.
The bus was late.
The traffic was terrible.
I couldn’t find a parking spot.
I got lost coming here.
I was tied up in a meeting.
I just lost track of time.

Your guess is as good as mine.
I’m debating between option A and option B
I can’t make up my mind.
I’m on the fence.
I’ll take that into consideration.
On the other hand it's not that expensive.
I’m having second thoughts.
I changed my mind.
He persuaded me to move in with him.
Looking back, I know it was the right decision.
It’s up to you.
Good luck!
Better luck next time.
Just my luck!
Lucky you!
That was a stroke of luck.
Some people have all the luck.
As luck would have it…
He’s down on his luck.
No such luck.
What rotten luck!
I’m scared that I will not have enough money.
I can’t help thinking that I forgot something.
It’s been keeping me up at night.
What if it isn't true?
Thank goodness!
What a relief!
You had me worried for a moment.
You have no idea what a relief it is.
That’s a huge load off my mind.
It’ll happen any day now.
It’s right around the corner.
It will arrive in the near future.
It won’t happen in our lifetime.
It’s a sign of things to come.
I’m counting down the days until…
It’s bound to happen eventually.

I’m positive that she feels the same way.
I have no doubt that he will bring the package.
I’m a hundred percent certain.
I’m convinced that they are telling the truth.
Chances are that the package will be broken on delivery.
Odds are that there are no seats left.
I seriously doubt it.
I don’t think so.
Probably not.
It’s not very likely.
There’s not much chance of that.
I’d be very surprised if that happened.
I wouldn’t bet on it.
That’ll never happen.
It’s fascinating.
It’s intriguing.
I couldn’t tear myself away.
I couldn’t put it down.
I was so into it, I lost track of time.
It does nothing for me.
I was bored to tears.
I was bored to death.
I was dying of boredom.
It’s about as exciting as watching paint dry.
What’s the matter?
What’s wrong?
Are you all right?
You look a bit down.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Cheer up!
It’s not so bad.
Everything will be OK.
Look on the bright side.
It’s not the end of the world.
What a pity!
What a shame.
How disappointing.
That’s too bad.
Bummer.
It was a real letdown.
It didn’t live up to my expectations.
Yeah, right.
You're kidding.
You're pulling my leg.
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

He muttered.
She was beaming.
The kids were smiling from ear to ear.
He looked puzzled.
She grinned.
He winced when the doctor gave him an injection.
She gave me a dirty look.
She blushed.
His eyes were glazed over.
Why the long face?
Her expression was unreadable.
They got off on the wrong foot.
He got on the teacher’s bad side.
She took offense at his comment.
He has a chip on his shoulder.
She got bent out of shape.

Here’s to our success!
Another round of drinks, please.
Put it on my tab.
He’s a bit tipsy.
He’s completely wasted.
She’s trying to drown her sorrows.

It’s as light as a feather.
It’s as dry as a bone.
It’s as flat as a pancake.
He’s as mad as a hornet.
It’s as old as the hills.
It’s as quick as lightning.
She’s as sick as a dog.
He’s as strong as an ox.
They’re as different as night and day.
She’s as stubborn as a mule.
He’s as proud as a peacock.
She’s as white as a sheet.
It’s as solid as a rock.
It’s as good as new.
It’s as clear as mud.
I would like to check out.
It has become much cooler.
It's time you went to bed.
No spitting on the street.

A pink shell was found on the sandy beach.
Small children came to see him.
The grass and bushes were wet with dew.
The blind man counted his old coins.
A severe storm tore down the barn.
She called his name many times.
When you hear the bell, come quickly.
